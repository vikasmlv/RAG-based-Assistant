What are the seven objectives of the National IPR Policy 2016 as outlined in the reference note?,"['5 \n \nThe IPR System in India  \nThe origins of India’s IPR system date back to British colonial rule, when as \na colony the state enacted various rules and enforcement mechanisms pertaining to \nIP rights. Post -independence, India retained elements of these structu res while \nupdating some guiding regulations and other bureaucratic structures. As India \nmoved toward liberalization, privatization, and globalization in the 1990s and later, \nIndian policymakers made further adjustments to keep up with growing needs of \ndomestic and international stakeholders. Indian IPR Laws fully conform to the \nAgreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights under WTO \naegis. \nIPR Policy 2016 \n Adopted in May 2016, t he IPR Policy is a giant  leap by the Government of \nIndia to spur creativity and stimulate innovation.

The object ives of the \nPolicy are: \n1) IPR Awareness: Outreach and Promotion  - To create public awareness \nabout the economic, social and cultural benefits of IPRs among all sections. \n2) Generation of IPRs - To stimulate the generation of IPRs: India has a large \ntalent pool of scientific and technological talent spread over R&D \ninstitutions, enterprises, universities and technical institutes. There is a need \nto tap this fertile knowledge resource and stimulate the creation of IP assets.  \n(see Annexures II and III  for no. of applications for patents and top \npatentees.) \n3) Legal and Legislative Framework - To have strong and effective IPR laws, \nwhich balance the interests of rights owners with larger public interest. \n4) Administration and Management - To modernize and strengthen service -\noriented IPR administration.']","The seven objectives of the National IPR Policy 2016, as outlined in the context, are:
